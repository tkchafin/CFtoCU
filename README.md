# CFtoCU
Scripts to scale branch lengths of a tree to coalescent units, given a table of concordance factors

My version of code implemented in the [TICR](https://github.com/nstenz/TICR) 'getTreeBranchLengths.R' script



## Scripts
''''
annotateBranches.py   - Annotates branches from input treefile with coal units calculated from CFs
duplicate_quartets.py - Prints duplicated quartets in a CF file
missing_quartets.py   - Prints missing quartets in a CF file
sample_quartets.py    - Prints all possible quartets given a taxon list
ticr2cfs.sh           - Prints relevant columns from TICR output CFs file (to stdout)
